easy-module-archetype
=====================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-module-archetype.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DANS-KNAW/easy-module-archetype)

Generate a skeleton EASY Module.

SYNOPSIS
--------

       generate-easy-module.sh

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Creates an EASY scala project, prepopulated with common files and structure. It uses the 
[maven archetype plugin](http://maven.apache.org/archetype/maven-archetype-plugin).

The archetype serves two purposes:

* It sets up a skeleton project for you if you need to create a new EASY module.
* More importantly, the skeleton is set up to support the [current common practices].

### Features
* Stub Scala source, including:
    - Entry point for command line interface (`Command`)
    - Service starter for a `initd` type daemon.
    - Service class that starts up a Jetty instance
    - An App trait that reads in settings from a properties file.
    - Unit test that checks that parts of this `README.md` correpond with the output of the `--help`
      command line option.
    - Unit test that checks that the example configuration supporting the execution of the program
      by Maven contain the configuration keys that are expected by the program.
* Stub assembly resources:
    - Command line starter script, `initd` and `systemd` scripts.
    - Configuration files (`application.properties` and separate logback config files for command line
      and daemon execution.)
    - Assembly descriptor for the `tar.gz` archive.
* Stub RPM configuration:
    - A profile in the POM that configures the `rpm-maven-plugin`. This allows you to build the RPM (`mvn clean install -Prpm`)
      (Requires RPM to be installed. On the Mac: `brew install rpm`.)
    - Hook scripts, partially implemented, that will execute during RPM installation (before/after install and 
      before/after remove).
* Probably more, by the time your read this...

ARGUMENTS
----------

The `generate-easy-module.sh` script will interactively query you for argument values.

EXAMPLES
--------

This assumes that you have copied the `generate-easy-module.sh` script to a directory that is on your `$PATH`. On
the Mac that could be `/usr/local/bin`

    $ cd ~/git/my-test-projects
    $ generate-easy-module.sh
    > easy-module-archetype version? (default = 1.x-SNAPSHOT): [Enter]
    > Module artifactId (e.g., easy-test-module): easy-hello-world [Enter]
    > Name module's main package (i.e. the one under nl.knaw.dans.easy): hello [Enter]
    > Description (one to four sentences): Simple example \ [Enter]
      that demonstrates that this generation script works. [Enter]

Now, you are all set to start developing, except ...    

### Delete what you do not use!

The skeleton project contains stubs for a daemon with an HTTP interface and a command line application, and by the time you read this,
possibly more stubs. *It is important to delete the parts that you are not going to use*, to avoid clutter. Yes, even if you may use it
in the future, just delete the stuff! For example: if you only need a command line application, you should delete

* the daemon scripts in `src/main/assembly/bin`,
* the service-related classes,
* the `run-service` sub-command,
* maybe some other things as well: check!


INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------

* Add `http://maven.dans.knaw.nl/` as a plug-in repository if you want to use a release version of this plug-in.
* Clone and build the project if you want to use a snapshot.


DEVELOPMENT
-----------
