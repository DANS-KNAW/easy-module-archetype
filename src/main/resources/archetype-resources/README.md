INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
------------------------------
Currently this project is build only as an RPM package for RHEL7/CentOS7 and later. The RPM will install the binaries to
`/opt/dans.knaw.nl/${artifactId}`, the configuration files to `/etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/${artifactId}`,
and will install the service script for `systemd`. 

BUILDING FROM SOURCE
--------------------
Prerequisites:

* Java 8 or higher
* Maven 3.3.3 or higher
* RPM

Steps:
    
    git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/${artifactId}.git
    cd ${artifactId} 
    mvn clean install

If the `rpm` executable is found at `/usr/local/bin/rpm`, the build profile that includes the RPM 
packaging will be activated. If `rpm` is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using
Maven's `-P` switch: `mvn -Pprm install`.
